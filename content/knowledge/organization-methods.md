# Organization Methods

## Core Principles

### Everything Needs a Home
If an item doesn't have a designated spot, it becomes clutter. Assign a place for everything, then return items after use.

### One In, One Out
For every new item that enters the house, one similar item leaves. Prevents accumulation.

### The 90/90 Rule
If you haven't used it in 90 days and won't use it in the next 90, consider letting it go. (Exceptions: seasonal items, emergency supplies, sentimental items with limits.)

## Methods

### Zone-Based Organization
Divide your home into functional zones and organize each independently.

**Kitchen zones:**
- Cooking zone (near stove): pots, pans, oils, spatulas
- Prep zone (near counter): cutting boards, knives, mixing bowls
- Storage zone (pantry): dry goods, canned food, backup supplies
- Cleaning zone (under sink): dish soap, sponges, trash bags

**Closet zones:**
- Daily wear (eye level, easiest access)
- Seasonal (higher or deeper storage)
- Occasion wear (less accessible, protected)
- Accessories (dedicated drawer or shelf)

### The KonMari Method (Marie Kondo)
- Sort by category, not room (all clothes at once, all books at once)
- Hold each item: does it spark joy?
- Thank items you're letting go
- Fold and store vertically for visibility
- Best for: major decluttering overhauls

### The OHIO Method (Only Handle It Once)
- When you pick something up, deal with it immediately
- Mail: open, act, file, or trash. Don't create a "mail pile."
- Dishes: wash or load immediately, don't stack in the sink
- Best for: daily maintenance habits

## Routine Building

### Daily (15 minutes)
- Kitchen reset (clear counters, run/empty dishwasher)
- Quick pickup (return items to their homes)
- Wipe down bathroom sink/counter
- Process mail and papers

### Weekly (1-2 hours)
- Vacuum/mop all floors
- Clean bathrooms
- Laundry (wash, dry, fold, put away — same day)
- Wipe kitchen surfaces
- Take out trash and recycling
- Quick declutter of surfaces

### Monthly (2-3 hours)
- Deep clean one room (rotate monthly)
- Declutter one category or area
- Check maintenance calendar
- Restock household supplies

### Seasonal (Half day)
- Rotate seasonal items (clothes, decor, gear)
- Deep clean windows
- Organize garage/storage
- Maintenance checklist (see maintenance-schedules.md)

## Storage Solutions

### Maximize Vertical Space
- Shelving above doorways, in closets, in garages
- Over-door organizers
- Wall-mounted hooks and racks
- Stackable containers (clear, labeled)

### Hidden Storage
- Ottoman and bench storage
- Under-bed containers
- Drawer dividers
- Cabinet door organizers

### Labeling
- Label everything in shared storage (garage, pantry, seasonal bins)
- Use consistent label format
- Include contents AND date for seasonal/archived items
- Label makers or masking tape + marker both work

## Decluttering Decision Framework

| Keep | Let Go |
|------|--------|
| Use regularly | Haven't used in 1+ year |
| Genuinely love it | Keeping out of guilt |
| Irreplaceable sentimental value | "Might need someday" |
| In good condition and fits | Broken/stained and won't fix |
| Serves a clear purpose | Duplicate of something better |

**Disposal options:**
- **Donate:** Goodwill, local shelters, Buy Nothing groups
- **Sell:** Facebook Marketplace, eBay, consignment
- **Recycle:** Check local recycling guidelines
- **Trash:** Last resort, but sometimes necessary
