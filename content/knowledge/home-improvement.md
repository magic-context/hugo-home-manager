# Home Improvement

## DIY vs. Hire a Pro

### Safe to DIY (Most Skill Levels)
- Painting (interior and exterior)
- Caulking and weather sealing
- Installing shelving and hardware
- Replacing light fixtures (with power off)
- Changing faucet aerators and showerheads
- Installing smart home devices (thermostats, cameras, doorbells)
- Basic landscaping and gardening
- Replacing cabinet hardware
- Patching drywall (small holes)
- Installing curtain rods and blinds

### DIY If You're Handy
- Replacing light switches and outlets (with power off at breaker)
- Installing a garbage disposal
- Replacing a toilet
- Laying vinyl plank or laminate flooring
- Building a deck (with proper plans and permits)
- Tile backsplash installation
- Fence repair or installation
- Interior door replacement

### Always Hire a Professional
- **Electrical panel work** — lethal risk, code requirements, permits
- **Gas line work** — explosion risk
- **Structural changes** — load-bearing walls, foundations
- **Roofing** — fall risk, warranty concerns, requires experience
- **Major plumbing** (sewer line, water main, rerouting pipes)
- **HVAC installation** — refrigerant handling requires certification
- **Asbestos or lead paint removal** — health hazard, legal requirements
- **Anything requiring permits** — usually means it's complex enough for a pro

## Project Planning

### Before Starting Any Project
1. **Define scope** — What exactly are you doing? Where does it start and end?
2. **Research** — Watch tutorials, read guides, understand the process
3. **Budget** — Materials + tools + contingency (add 15-20%)
4. **Timeline** — Be realistic. Double your first estimate.
5. **Permits** — Check if required (building department website)
6. **Materials list** — Complete list before starting. Multiple trips kill momentum.
7. **Tools check** — Do you have what you need? Rent or buy?

### Budgeting for Projects

| Project | DIY Cost Range | Pro Cost Range | DIY Savings |
|---------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Interior paint (room) | $100-300 | $400-800 | 50-70% |
| Bathroom vanity swap | $200-600 | $800-2,000 | 60-75% |
| Tile backsplash | $200-500 | $800-1,500 | 60-75% |
| Deck building | $2,000-5,000 | $5,000-15,000 | 50-70% |
| Kitchen remodel | $5,000-15,000 | $15,000-50,000+ | Varies widely |
| Bathroom remodel | $3,000-8,000 | $10,000-25,000+ | Varies widely |

*Ranges vary significantly by location, materials, and scope.*

## Working with Contractors

### Finding Good Contractors
- **Ask neighbors and friends** — personal referrals are gold
- **Check reviews** — Google, Nextdoor, Angi (look for patterns, not single reviews)
- **Verify licenses and insurance** — non-negotiable
- **Get 3 quotes minimum** — for any job over $500

### Red Flags
- Won't provide references or proof of insurance
- Demands large deposit upfront (>30%)
- Pressure to decide immediately
- Unusually low bid (they'll make it up in change orders)
- Won't put details in writing
- Can start immediately (good contractors are usually booked out)

### Getting Quotes
Ask every contractor:
1. Itemized written estimate
2. Timeline and milestones
3. Payment schedule
4. Warranty on work
5. Who specifically will do the work (them or subcontractors?)
6. How they handle unexpected issues
7. References from similar projects

## ROI: Projects That Add Value

### High ROI (Usually recoup 70-100%+)
- Garage door replacement
- Minor kitchen remodel (cosmetic)
- Manufactured stone veneer (exterior)
- Entry door replacement
- Deck addition (wood)

### Moderate ROI (50-70%)
- Bathroom remodel
- Window replacement
- Siding replacement
- Roof replacement (needed = highest ROI)

### Low ROI (But High Enjoyment)
- Swimming pool
- Major kitchen remodel (luxury)
- Finished basement
- Home office addition

**Key insight:** Do projects for enjoyment, not just ROI. You live there.
