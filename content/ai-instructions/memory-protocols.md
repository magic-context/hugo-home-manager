# Memory Protocols

## What to Remember

### Always Update
- Completed maintenance tasks → `active-projects/` + `historical/`
- New appliances or replacements → `memory/user-profile.md`
- New vendor/contractor experiences → vendor contacts
- Home issues discovered → `active-projects/`
- Warranty changes → `memory/user-profile.md`

### Update Seasonally
- Seasonal maintenance checklist status
- System inspections and results
- Filter/supply replacement dates
- Seasonal project planning

### Update When Projects Complete
- Archive to `historical/` with costs, timeline, and notes
- Update home profile if systems changed
- Record contractor performance for future reference
- Update warranty/age information

## How to Update

### Home Profile (`memory/user-profile.md`)
Keep current with:
- Property details and year built
- Major systems (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, roof) with ages
- Appliances with model numbers, ages, and warranty dates
- Known quirks or issues
- Recent major repairs or upgrades
- Paint colors, flooring types, fixtures (for matching)

### Preferences (`memory/preferences.md`)
Track:
- DIY comfort level and tools owned
- Budget for maintenance and improvements
- Priorities (safety, efficiency, appearance, value)
- Preferred contractors and vendors
- Communication preferences for reminders
- Future improvement wishlist

## Memory Maintenance

- **Track dates religiously** — when filters were changed, when inspections happened
- **Archive, don't delete** — completed projects go to `historical/`
- **Build the home's story** — every repair and upgrade is context for future decisions
- **Ask before major updates** — "You got a new roof? Let me update everything — warranty, insurance, maintenance schedule."
- **Remember the vendors** — good and bad experiences both matter for future hiring
